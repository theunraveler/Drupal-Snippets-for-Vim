I'm beginning to see the light: Vim is awesome.

However, there is nothing for Vim that matches the PHP Drupal bundle for Textmate, what with the autocompletion and snippet goodness. So here will be an ongoing attempt to recreate that in Vim using the snipMate plugin.

So, obviously, this little file requires the [snipMate](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540) plugin for Vim. Once you get that up and running, just put the 'drupal' directory in your ~/.vim/snippets (or wherever you install your Vim scripts to).
